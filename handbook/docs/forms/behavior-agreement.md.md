# Wildland Firefighter Behavior Agreement Form

## Purpose

This agreement outlines the expected behavior and conduct of personnel assigned to the Type 2 Handcrew. It ensures mutual understanding and accountability on mission.

## Expectation 

Each crewmember is expected to maintain professionalism, discipline, and respect toward all personnel, leadership, and partner agencies. Orders from the Crew Boss or designated leadership must be followed unless they pose immediate danger or violate law. Crewmembers will adhere to all fireline safety protocols, maintain accountability, and support a positive team environment through proper conduct and communication. Prohibited conduct includes harassment, discrimination, use of alcohol or illicit drugs while on mission, unauthorized absence, insubordination, unsafe acts, theft, vandalism, and tampering with any crew or agency equipment. Such actions may result in immediate removal from assignment and formal reporting to the appropriate authorities or military command. Concerns about misconduct or unsafe behavior should be promptly reported to the Crew Boss or Squad Leader, and formal reports may be submitted using the Incident Behavior Report Form when applicable.
