**Inappropriate Behavior:**

It is extremely important that inappropriate behavior be recognized and
dealt with promptly. Inappropriate behavior is all forms of harassment
including sexual and racial harassment. **Harassment in any form will
not be tolerated.** When you observe or hear of inappropriate behavior
you should:

- Inform and educate subordinates of their rights and responsibilities.

- Document and report inappropriate behavior and report it to the
  appropriate supervision or Wildland Fire Program Manager.

  all private property.

- While in the public view, conduct yourself in a professional manner
  that represents the OkMD Wildland Fire Program in a positive light.
  Refrain from vulgar or offensive language, gestures, or other
  unprofessional behavior.

**Drugs and Alcohol:**

- Non-prescription unlawful drugs and alcohol are not permitted at any
  time.

  action.

- During off-incident rest periods, personnel are responsible for proper
  conduct and maintenance of fitness for duty. Drug or alcohol abuse
  resulting in unfitness for duty will result in removal from the
  program.

  abuse.
