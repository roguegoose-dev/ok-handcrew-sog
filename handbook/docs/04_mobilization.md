# 5. Mobilization Procedures

Mobilization begins long before a fire assignment and doesnâ€™t end when the call comes in â€” it ends when the crew hits the fireline, ready. This section outlines both the pre-call expectations and the step-by-step process from notification to departure.

## 5.1 Between Assignments: Crew Readiness

Readiness is not optional. Crewmembers are expected to stay deployable and responsive throughout the fire season.

### âœ… Gear Readiness
- Red bag must be packed and ready for immediate load
- Boots, PPE, and Nomex gear must be clean, labeled, and serviceable
- Fire shelter must be packed, current, and checked regularly
- Line pack must be maintained and stowed in a deployable state

### âœ… Credentials
- Red card must be current and accessible
- RT-130 refresher and pack test must be completed before season opens
- IQWS must be up to date â€” any missing training should be reported

### âœ… Availability Status
- Update BaseConnect when your availability changes
- Do not mark available if you are physically unready or unavailable due to work, school, or gear issues
- Notify Squad Boss or Readiness NCO immediately if your status changes after marking available

## 5.2 Reporting Location

All crew mobilizations originate from:

**Camp Gruber Training Center â€“ Braggs, OK**

Mobilizations generally occur the **day after notification**. Crew members are expected to report to Gruber **on the day they are notified** to stage, receive briefing, load gear, and prepare for next-day departure.

Failure to arrive on time without prior coordination may result in removal from the assignment.

## 5.3 Notification Protocol

Activation status will be communicated through multiple redundant channels:

- **Primary:** BaseConnect  
- **Alternate:** GroupMe  
- **Direct Contact:** Phone/text from Squad Boss or CRWB

Squad Bosses are responsible for:
- Notifying assigned squad members
- Verifying personal and gear readiness
- Reporting accountability to the CRWB or Readiness NCO

Each Squad Boss will maintain:
- Printed roster of assigned personnel
- Gear status checklist (optional)
- Emergency contact log for crew members

---

## 5.4 Vehicle Preparation & Travel

All transport will be coordinated by fire program leadership.

**Vehicle options:**
- **Preferred:** State-owned 4x4 crew trucks or command vehicles
- **Alternate:** State-leased vans or other authorized transport

All assigned vehicles must be:
- Fueled and inspected prior to departure
- Stocked with:
  - Radio (programmed and functional)
  - First aid kit
  - Drinking water
  - PPE bags staged per squad
- Logged in the mobilization packet

> ðŸ”¸ *Vehicle lead is designated by the CRWB prior to departure. Driving conduct reflects the program â€” zero tolerance for unsafe or unprofessional behavior.*

---

## 5.5 Travel Expectations

- All crewmembers must wear either:
  - Fireline gear (Nomex), or  
  - Wildland pants + OKMD/fire tee + boots  
- No athletic shorts, flip flops, or unprofessional dress during mobilization
- Headcount is conducted before and after each stop
- Crews must remain together unless otherwise directed by CRWB or higher authority

> ðŸŸ© Mobilization is not downtime â€” it's the first impression. Show up sharp, stay organized, and act like weâ€™re already on the fireline.
