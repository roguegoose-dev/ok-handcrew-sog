# 9. Demobilization Procedures

Demobilization is the process of wrapping up a fire assignment with the same discipline and cohesion used to launch it. This section outlines the expectations and required actions for all crewmembers after the mission concludes.

A clean exit sets the tone for your next call-up. We leave no gear unaccounted for, no paperwork undone, and no lessons uncollected.

---

## 9.1 Final Operational Closure

At the incident’s conclusion:

- CRWB or assigned leadership will attend formal demob briefings
- Crew will secure and stage tools, PPE, and vehicles per instructions
- A gear accountability sweep will be conducted at the incident or at return point
- Squad Bosses will verify that all personnel are accounted for and fit to travel

---

## 9.2 Travel Home and Crew Conduct

Return travel is still considered part of the mission.

- Crewmembers are expected to maintain professional conduct until officially released
- Meals, fuel, and hygiene stops will be coordinated by the CRWB or vehicle lead
- Squad Bosses will perform one final gear and crew check upon arrival

Any equipment damage or injury noted during travel must be reported to the CRWB before release.

---

## 9.3 Gear Reset and Turn-In

Upon return to Camp Gruber:

- Red bags, tools, and assigned items must be cleaned, inventoried, and stowed
- Radios and electronic gear are to be returned to charge stations or tech coordinator
- Saw kits and fuel equipment inspected by assigned personnel
- PPE must be staged in designated locations for inspection or reissue
- Damaged gear must be tagged and logged immediately

> The standard is: "Better than you found it.”

---

## 9.4 After Action Review (AAR)

An AAR will be conducted within **72 hours** of return.

Led by the CRWB or assigned Squad Boss, the AAR includes:

- Mission summary and notable observations
- Operational successes and areas for improvement
- Safety, gear, and personnel feedback
- Updates to SOPs or practices based on real-world lessons

Participation in the AAR is mandatory unless excused by command.

---

## 9.5 Evaluations and Documentation

Each fire assignment is a chance to grow — and that means it must be documented.

### 🔹 Required Evaluations:
- FFT2 evaluations (mid-assignment and/or final)
- FFT1-T, CRWB-T, and FAL evals (as applicable)
- Equipment feedback forms (for tools, radios, saws)

Squad Bosses are responsible for ensuring these are submitted to the CRWB or Readiness NCO before crew is released from duty.

> 🔸 You don’t advance on this crew without evaluation and accountability.

---

## 9.6 Release and Reset

The mission is not complete until every piece is reset and every crewmember is accounted for.

Before final release:
- Squad Bosses confirm completion of evaluations and gear turn-in
- CRWB submits closing documentation to state or agency reps
- Medical follow-ups are logged if applicable
- Final BaseConnect status set to “Returned”

> 🟩 Demobilization isn't the end — it's the reload. What we do here determines how ready we are for the next fire.
