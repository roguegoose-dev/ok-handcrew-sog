## 2. Organizational Framework

The Oklahoma National Guard Type 2 Handcrew operates under the command structure of the Oklahoma Military Department and is coordinated through Camp Gruber during wildland fire mobilizations.

### 2.1 Chain of Command

The reporting location for all crew activations is:
**Camp Gruber Training Center â€“ Braggs, OK**

All crew members will fall under the authority of the assigned **Crew Boss (CRWB)** and will follow the organizational hierarchy established for each deployment, which typically includes:
- 1 Crew Boss (CRWB)
- 1 Crew Boss Trainee (CRWB-T) if assigned
- 3-4 Squad Bosses (FFT1)
- 10 - 14 Firefighters (FFT2)
- 1 or more Sawyers (FAL2 or FAL3)
- 1 Line Medic

> ðŸŸ¡ *Note: Roles may vary by assignment. Squad structure and leadership assignment will be determined based on availability and crew qualifications at the time of mobilization.*

Additional roles and resposibility may be required for administrative functions between assignments to include:

### 2.2 Oversight and Review

These SOPs/SOGs are intended to be living documents. They will be reviewed:
- Annually by the designated fire leadership at Camp Gruber
- After each fire assignment during the crewâ€™s After Action Review (AAR)
- Anytime significant procedural changes or lessons learned arise

Crew members and leaders are encouraged to contribute feedback and help refine this framework over time.

### 2.3 Interagency Participation (TBD)

While this SOP is specific to Oklahoma National Guard operations, there may be future interagency partnerships with state, tribal, or federal resources. Should those be formalized, additional coordination language will be added here.

> ðŸŸ¡ *Placeholder: Expand this section if/when partnerships with agencies like Oklahoma Forestry Services or local fire departments become standardized.*
