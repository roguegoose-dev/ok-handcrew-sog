## 3. LCES & Safety Zones

### LCES Checklist
- Lookouts
- Communications
- Escape Routes
- Safety Zones

### Safety Zones & Escape Routes
- 4x flame height rule
- No downhill escape without timed walkthrough
- Flagging conventions (pink, yellow, orange, etc.)

---

## 4. Communications

### Radio Use Protocol
- Who you're calling, who you are
- Confirmed instructions
- Common language: Affirmative, Negative, Emergency Traffic

### Comms Planning Table (Example)

## 5. Medical & Medevac

### Medical Incident Report Format
9-line medevac format adapted to ICS style:
1. Incident Name  
2. Number of patients  
3. Nature of injury  
4. Location (GPS or landmark)  
5. Frequency  
6. Contact on scene  
7. Special needs  
8. Extraction method  
9. Additional resources

### Emergency Medical Plan
- Who calls
- How to communicate
- Where to extract
- Who is EMT

---

## 6. Hazards & Field Awareness

### Known Hazards
- Rolling material
- Hazard trees/snags
- Lee slopes and chimney effects
- Powerlines / pipeline crossings

### Flagging Standards
- Orange â€“ Fireline
- Pink â€“ Escape Route
- Lime â€“ Safety Zone
- Blue/White â€“ Medical

---

## 7. Fireline Operations

### Line Construction Safety
- Anchor, flank, pinch
- Downhill line precautions
- Spot fire protocol

### Wind / Heat / Fuel Awareness
- Watch for sudden wind shifts
- Monitor RH and temps
- Adjust line tactics for slope and load

---

## 8. Air Operations

### Air Coordination Basics
- Maintain air-to-ground contact
- Maintain LZ safety and security
- No approach unless directed

---

## 9. Structure Defense (WUI)

| Triage | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Defensible w/ resources | Stay & defend |
| Defensible â€“ no resources | Prep & leave |
| Not defensible | Leave early |

Use ribbon: âœ… = Checked, ðŸš« = Not defensible

---

## 10. Weather

### Watch-Out Indicators
- Hot, dry, unstable air
- RH <25%
- Sudden wind shifts
- Rapid changes in fire behavior

---

## 11. Crew Morale & Fatigue

### Heat Illness Prevention
- 1 gallon/day minimum
- Salts every break
- Monitor teammates

### Fatigue Signs
- Slurred speech
- Missed instructions
- Poor tool handling
