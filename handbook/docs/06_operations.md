## 7. Crew Operations

This section defines the daily operational rhythm of the OKMD Wildland Fire Program Type II Handcrew — from fire station staging through fireline execution to post-assignment reset.

These aren’t just guidelines — this is how we operate at an exceptional level. These standards reflect what is expected of every crew member, Squad Boss, and Crew Boss when representing this team.

> **Every step is intentional. Every task is accountable. Every moment is an opportunity to set the tone for how the job is done.**


## 7.1 Pre-Operational Procedures

This section outlines what is expected of every crewmember from the moment they report to the station or staging point. Whether we are preparing for a state activation, a readiness exercise, or mobilization to a national incident, these procedures are non-negotiable.

These are the standards of the OKMD Wildland Fire Program Type II Handcrew — not preferences.
