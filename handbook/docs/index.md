# OkMD Wildland Fire Program - Type 2 Handcrew Handbook

## 1. Introduction

Welcome to the OkMD Wildland Fire Program - Type 2 Handcrew.

This is more than a fireline crew — it’s a mission-driven team forged from military discipline, interagency collaboration, and the fireground realities that demand clarity, humility, and decisive action.

This handbook was built to define who we are, how we operate, and what we expect from each other. Whether you’re here for your initial training or returning for another fire season, this document sets the tone for how we work, communicate, and lead.

## 1.1 Our Founding and Purpose

This crew was formed to answer a critical need: to bring Guard soldiers into wildland fire operations at a high standard of readiness, safety, and effectiveness. Built from the ground up, we established this handbook to give clear, practical guidance — not just policy — that reflects real fireline conditions and Guard professionalism.

Our mission is simple: support the fight against wildland fire, protect life and property, and return home safe, together.

## 1.2 A Unique Team, A Unique Challenge

This crew is built from across the state and across the force:  
Mechanics. Medics. Infantry. Engineers. MPs. Officers. NCOs. Junior enlisted.  
Every MOS. Every background. Every rank.

And that diversity is our strength — it brings perspective, capability, and a level of adaptability few crews can match.

But it also brings challenges. Let’s be clear:

- **Your military rank does not determine your fireline role.**
- A private first class with fireline quals may lead a squad that includes a field grade officer.
- A sergeant might take instruction from a newer firefighter who holds the appropriate assignment.
- The chain of command on the line is determined by certification, training, and assigned duty — not seniority or time-in-grade.

This isn’t a slight to your rank. It’s a realignment to support safety and effectiveness. Wildland fire operations are dangerous, fast-moving, and require **clear roles and decisive leadership** — not confusion over who outranks who in garrison.

You’ll see this theme again in our Conduct and Crew Operations sections — but we’re setting the tone right here:

> **Check the ego. Trust the structure. Respect the fireline chain of command.**

## 1.3 Why Safety Comes First

Every protocol in this handbook, every process, every form, every line of tape we hang — it exists to get us home. This isn’t bureaucracy. It’s life-and-death decision-making, compressed into 16-hour shifts in dynamic terrain.

Safety isn’t a suggestion. It’s the job.

We don’t compromise on it, and we don’t tolerate those who do.

## 1.4 What This Handbook Is

This book is:
- A crew member’s guide — from pre-mob to demob
- A tactical reference — built from IRPG principles and field feedback
- A leadership tool — with evals, checklists, and procedures you can actually use

It will grow. It will change. It will get better with every mobilization and readiness excercise — because we’re building it together.

Welcome to the crew.  
Time to get to work.
