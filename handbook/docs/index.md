## 1. Introduction

This Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) and Standard Operating Guidelines (SOG) document provides the framework for safe, effective, and consistent operations of the Oklahoma National Guard Type 2 Handcrew. This includes protocols for mobilization, conduct, crew composition, equipment standards, and administrative requirements.

These SOPs/SOGs are specific to operations originating from Camp Gruber and are tailored for Oklahoma-based deployments and interagency collaboration.

## 2. Organizational Framework

The Oklahoma National Guard Type 2 Handcrew operates under the command structure of the Oklahoma Military Department and is coordinated through Camp Gruber during wildland fire mobilizations.

### 2.1 Chain of Command

The reporting location for all crew activations is:
**Camp Gruber Training Center – Braggs, OK**

All crew members will fall under the authority of the assigned **Crew Boss (CRWB)** and will follow the organizational hierarchy established for each deployment, which typically includes:
- 1 Crew Boss (CRWB)
- 1 Crew Boss Trainee (CRWB-T) if assigned
- 3 Squad Bosses (FFT1 or ICT5)
- Firefighters (FFT2)
- 1 or more Sawyers (FALB or FALA)
- 1 EMT-B (if available)

> 🟡 *Note: Roles may vary by assignment. Squad structure and leadership assignment will be determined based on availability and crew qualifications at the time of mobilization.*

### 2.2 Oversight and Review

These SOPs/SOGs are intended to be living documents. They will be reviewed:
- Annually by the designated fire leadership at Camp Gruber
- After each fire assignment during the crew’s After Action Review (AAR)
- Anytime significant procedural changes or lessons learned arise

Crew members and leaders are encouraged to contribute feedback and help refine this framework over time.

### 2.3 Interagency Participation (TBD)

While this SOP is specific to Oklahoma National Guard operations, there may be future interagency partnerships with state, tribal, or federal resources. Should those be formalized, additional coordination language will be added here.

> 🟡 *Placeholder: Expand this section if/when partnerships with agencies like Oklahoma Forestry Services or local fire departments become standardized.*

## 3. Season of Operation

The crew will primarily operate during high fire risk seasons, typically from late spring through early fall. Availability periods will be determined based on Oklahoma fire conditions, crew readiness, and coordination with state/federal resources.

### 3.1 Rotation Schedule

While exact rotation policies are under development, crew availability may be structured around 2-week blocks. Each period will include designated overhead (Crew Boss, Squad Bosses) and a roster of qualified firefighters.

> 🟡 *Placeholder: Add specific dates and coordination protocol once deployment tempo is established.*

### 3.2 Roster Evaluation

Before each availability window, leadership will assess roster readiness, training completion, and home unit commitments to determine crew availability.

## 4. Crew Composition and Qualifications

A standard Type 2 Handcrew includes:

- 1 Crew Boss (CRWB)
- 1 Crew Boss Trainee (CRWB-T, if available)
- 3 Squad Bosses (FFT1 or ICT5)
- 3+ Sawyers (FALB, FALA)
- 1 EMT-B (if available)
