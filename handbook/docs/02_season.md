## 3. Season of Operation

The crew will primarily operate during high fire risk seasons, typically from late spring through early fall. Availability periods will be determined based on Oklahoma fire conditions, crew readiness, and coordination with state/federal resources.

### 3.1 Rotation Schedule

While exact rotation policies are under development, crew availability may be structured around 2-week blocks. Each period will include designated overhead (Crew Boss, Squad Bosses) and a roster of qualified firefighters.

Before each availability window, leadership will assess roster readiness, training completion, and home unit commitments to determine crew availability.
