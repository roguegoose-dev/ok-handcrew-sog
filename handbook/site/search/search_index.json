It\u2019s a realignment to support safety and effectiveness. Wildland fire operations are dangerous, fast-moving, and require clear roles and decisive leadership \u2014 not confusion over who outranks who in garrison.</p> <p>You\u2019ll see this theme again in our Conduct and Crew Operations sections \u2014 but we\u2019re setting the tone right here:</p> <p>Check the ego.
